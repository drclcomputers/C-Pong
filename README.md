This is a C++ implementation of the original Pong video game made for single-player use.
It is written in the graphics.h library and is compiled static so it should work on any computer.

The Controls:
-'right arrow' and 'left arrow' for movement
-in the main menu, '1, 2, 3' to choose the difficulty (1 - easy, 2 - medium, 3 - Hard)
-in the main menu, 'enter' to start the game

It works from Windows XP all the way up to Windows 11. I tried testing it in Windows 95 but I keep getting an error regarding some unexisting DLL files. I tried to download them manually but I still get an error about some linkers. I haven't tested on Win 98 or ME.
